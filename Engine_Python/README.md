# 🧬 NEnterprise AI: Python Orchestration Layer

This directory contains the **Python-based orchestration and forensic monitoring suite** for the NEnterprise AI framework. These models manage high-level logic and real-time reporting for the neural DNA substrate.

## 🚀 Performance Benchmarks
* **Average Latency per Model:** ~5ms
* **Total Pipeline Execution:** <0.07s
* **Gradient Baseline:** 0.0054 Basal Accountability

## 🛠️ Framework Overview
This suite operates across 11 distinct models:
1. **01-04 (Foundation):** Stability, chain of custody, and homeostatic governance.
2. **05-08 (Governance):** Steering lineage, population coding, and IP isolation.
3. **09-11 (Forensics):** Ancestral audit, state synthesis, and logic reconstruction.

## 🚦 Usage
To run the full forensic audit sequence:
`python nenterprise_master.py`

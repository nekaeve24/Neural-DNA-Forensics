# NEnterprise AI: Forensic Auditing & IP Management
> **Sovereign Intelligence Governance for the 2026 Regulatory Landscape.**

## Executive Summary
NEnterprise AI provides institutional-grade forensic audits for neural architectures. Our proprietary methodology treats neural weights as "Neural DNA," applying evolutionary biology principles to ensure AI safety, IP defensibility, and regulatory compliance.

## The Lineage of Intelligence
This framework is built upon a decade-long intellectual moat, beginning with the Principal's 2015 research at Columbia University:
* **Thesis Foundation:** *Genetics and the Consumer: An Evaluation of the Direct-to-Consumer Genetics Industry in Society (2015)*.

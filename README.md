## 🏗 The 11-Model Forensic Pipeline
This repository contains the Python-based **Observation & Orchestration Layer**. The high-performance mathematical core remains proprietary (C++).

### 01. Integrity Gate
- **Basis:** Welford's Algorithm for Online Variance.
- **Function:** Establishes biological 'Homeostatic Baselines' to prevent systemic shock from volatile data inputs.

### 02. Forensic Chain
- **Basis:** Mathematical Chain of Custody.
- **Function:** Links every evolutionary step of the neural substrate into an immutable cryptographic sequence.

### 03. Attractor Safeguard
- **Basis:** Dynamical Systems Stability.
- **Function:** Identifies and secures 'Fixed-Point' attractors to prevent dead-end logic loops.

### 04. Homeostatic Governor
- **Basis:** Negative Feedback Loops.
- **Function:** Regulatory layer that dampens extreme outputs to maintain systemic equilibrium.

### 05. Steering Lineage
- **Basis:** Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Traversal.
- **Function:** Ensures model learning trajectory remains aligned with the NEnterprise Root Baseline.

### 06. Population Coder
- **Basis:** Distributed Neural Representation.
- **Function:** Analyzes weight distribution across the neural population to prevent single-point bias.

### 07. Error Correction
- **Basis:** Hebbian Learning Refinement.
- **Function:** Real-time rectification of logic drift using the 0.0054 gradient.

### 08. Proprietary Vault
- **Basis:** Data Sovereignty Protocols.
- **Function:** Isolation and encryption of critical forensic signatures.

### 09. Phylogenetic Audit
- **Basis:** Cladistics and Forensic Neural Archaeology.
- **Function:** Traces the 'genetic' history of model weights to identify the origin of specific knowledge sets.

### 10. Model Synthesis
- **Basis:** Cross-Domain Data Fusion.
- **Function:** Consolidates validated forensic nodes into comprehensive institutional reports.

### 11. Logic Reconstruction
- **Basis:** Predictive Forensic Modeling.
- **Function:** Extrapolates validated past narratives to assess future model reliability.
